    <h1>WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h1>
    <b1>Our reality is shaped by bits of information, selectively given to us, and the way these bits are shown. In a way, we can say, it is curated by the structures that hierarchically own the power of knowing and revealing. We tend to believe in the notion of objectivity, and even if we approach the media input - most obvious example - critically, we still speculate on the different fields, looking for conspiracy theories and whatnot. We as graphic designers are among those people who are substantially aware of the power of the image and how it can manipulate other’s perceptions. One can argue that the way of perceiving the message depends on the content.

The Manipulator of Data: Kasper Northemier is a digital experiment to investigate how the manipulation of data can be visually and easily achieved through a credible and believing hoax. It challenges the methods of design process with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of data.
<br><br>
I tricked the whole Glasgow School of Art and other art schools in Singapore into thinking that there is an exclusive talk by a fictional Dutch designer named Kasper Northemier. Creating a promotional posters, websites, fake e-mails and fake application forms, I collated these data and continue to manipulate them. Subsequently releasing it as a hoax, the result was great.
