   By continuing to use TIMOTIKN’s services, you signify that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time in respect of Kasper Northemier Talk’s collection, use and disclosure of your Customer Data.  This Privacy Policy is divided into two Parts – A and B:<br>

  	•	Part B: Privacy policy statement for Customer Data collected through TIMOTIKN’s websites.<br>
<br>
  Part A: General Customer Data privacy policy statement<br>
  1. Types of Customer Data
<br><br>
  The types of Customer Data that TIMOTIKN collects depends on the circumstances of collection and on the nature of the service requested or transaction undertaken.   There are two broad categories of Customer Data that TIMOTIKN collects:<br>
  	•	Personal Data, which includes but is not limited to - <br> (i) personal information that links back to an individual e.g., name, gender, date of birth, passport or other personal identification numbers, images, photographs, videos, closed circuit television (CCTV) footage, voice recordings;   (ii) contact information e.g., address, phone number, email address;  <br>
  For purposes of this policy statement, the phrase Customer Data includes Personal Data and Statistical Data.   In some cases, TIMOTIKN needs you to provide Customer Data in order for TIMOTIKN to be able to carry out its services to you. Where it is not necessary, the field will be marked "optional" in the forms used to collect personal data.   The failure to supply such Customer Data may result in (i) TIMOTIKN being unable to provide you with the services and/or products requested; <br>(ii) TIMOTIKN being unable to update you on our latest products and/or launches; and/or (iii) your inability to enter or participate in contests, promotions or redemption activities organised by TIMOTIKN.<br>
<br>
  2. Purposes for Collection, Use and Disclosure<br>
  Generally, TIMOTIKN collects Customer Data, either directly from you or from your authorised representatives (i.e. persons whom you have authorised, persons who have been validly identified as being you or your authorised representative pursuant to our then-current security procedures), from third parties, or from publicly available sources, through our website, in order to fulfil the following purposes, which include but are not limited to:<br>
  	•	Allowing for the experiment to conduct data analysis.<br>
  	•	Manipulating the data obtained to create possible outcomes, but all outcomes will solely be for research purpose and will not be shared with any third parties outside of TIMOTIKN.<br>
<br>
  TIMOTIKN will not use and disclose your Customer Data with and to third parties excluding Google, as the application form resides on Google Forms.   TIMOTIKN shall use its best endeavours to ensure such other third parties mentioned above who are involved in the collection, use and disclosure of Customer Data will observe and adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy. 
   TIMOTIKN may disclose your Customer Data to law enforcement agencies and government for security, customs and immigration purposes.  In addition, TIMOTIKN may disclose Customer Data to our legal advisors for establishing, exercising or defending our legal rights, to our other professional advisors, or as otherwise authorised or required by law. TIMOTIKN also reserves the right to share Customer Data as is necessary to prevent a threat to the life, health or security of an individual or corporate entities such as TIMOTIKN. Further, TIMOTIKN may disclose Customer Data, as is necessary, to investigate suspected unlawful activities including but not limited to fraud, intellectual property infringement or privacy.

<br><br>
  3. Access
<br>
  TIMOTIKN will, upon your written request to our operation, allow you to view your stored Personal Data. In exceptional circumstances,   Exceptional circumstances include (to the extent allowable under applicable law) where:<br>
  	•	An investigating authority or government institution objects to TIMOTIKN complying with a customer’s request,<br>
  	•	The information may, in the exercise of TIMOTIKN’s reasonable discretion and/or assessment, affect the life or security of an individual, and<br>
  	•	Data is collected in connection with an investigation of a breach of contract, suspicion of fraudulent activities or contravention of law.<br>

  To submit a written request to operation to access your Personal Data, please use email to kyleandgo@gmail.com.<br>
<br>
  4. Retention<br>
  TIMOTIKN will retain Customer Data for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected, the legal or business purposes of TIMOTIKN, or as required by relevant laws.   When destroying Customer Data, we will take commercially reasonable and technically possible measures to make the personal information irrecoverable or irreproducible in accordance with the applicable laws.<br>
<br>
  5. Accuracy<br>

  TIMOTIKN needs your assistance to ensure that your Personal Data is current, complete and accurate. As such, please inform TIMOTIKN of changes to your Personal Data by contacting TIMOTIKN and submitting your updated particulars to TIMOTIKN in writing.  <br>
<br>
  6. Security safeguards<br>

  TIMOTIKN takes the security and protection of your Customer Data very seriously. As such, TIMOTIKN makes reasonable security arrangements to protect your Customer Data against loss or theft as well as unauthorised access and undue disclosure.   As an example of a procedural safeguard, TIMOTIKN has implemented various authentication procedures internally and with our external service providers that may involve TIMOTIKN requesting various personal particulars from you in order to verify your identity (or that of your duly authorised agent) before TIMOTIKN processes your request for a particular service, product or transaction.  <br>
<br>
  7. Updates to the privacy policy<br>

  TIMOTIKN will amend this Privacy Policy from time to time without notice, and the updated versions will be posted on TIMOTIKN’s website and date stamped so that you are aware of when the Privacy Policy was last updated. Subject to applicable laws, the English version of this Privacy Policy will prevail over any version of this Privacy Policy in another language. In the event of any inconsistency in interpretation between the English version and any translation of the Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy statement in English will prevail.<br>
